// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.

// Store the names of these animals in a list,
let animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'chicks']
// and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. 
for(let i=0;i<animals.length;i++){
    console.log(`${animals[i]}`)
}
for(let i=0;i<animals.length;i++){
    console.log(`A ${animals[i]} would like a great pet.`)
}
console.log('such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!')





// • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
