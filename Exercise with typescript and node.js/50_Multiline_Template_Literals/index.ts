// Use template literals to create a multiline string that describes your ideal day. Include at least three different activities.

// Explain & TIP: Template literals support multiline strings, making it easier to create readable text blocks that incorporate variables and expressions.

let myIdealDay = `My ideal day would involve:
1. Waking up early and going for a jog.
2. Spending a few hours coding on a personal project.
3. Ending the day by reading a good book.`;
console.log(myIdealDay);
